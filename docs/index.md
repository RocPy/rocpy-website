# About

_From the banks of the mighty Genesee River, deep in the heart of the Greater
Rochester Area, welcome! We are your organizers coming to you from an
undisclosed server rack in the heart of Python country. Here, where code is our
lifeblood, and algorithms our heartbeat._

---

RocPy is Rochester's local (and only!) Python user group. We exist to give
others the opportunity to work and play with local Python developers, learners,
employers, and enthusiasts. All skill levels are welcome, if you are interested
in Python, join us!

We have monthly presentation series with 30-60 minutes presentations on topics of interest to the Python community.
